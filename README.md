# Global Biodiversity Decline as Related to Farming

A data analytics project attempting to correlate the global decline of biodiversity with the increase in farmland per region.


### Instructions
1. Refer to **requirements.txt**.
2. Ensure modules are installed and Python is updated to at least 3.9.16.
3. Open and run **living_planet.ipynb.** This will display a graph and create an Excel file named 'living-planet-spread.xlsx'.
4. Open and run **fao_land_data.ipynb**. This will display a graoh and create an Excel file named 'fao_land_data_spread.xlsx'.
5. Open **streamlit-living-land.py**.
6. In terminal, run `streamlit run streamlit-living-land.py`. This will open a new window in your browser of the streaamlit app.
7. Alternatively, you can visit this [link](https://kabfare-biodiversity-decline-streamlit-living-land-xrt9r7.streamlit.app) to view the app.

### Features
1. Read in data from a local csv and excel file.
2. Use built-in pandas functions to clean and manipulate data.
3. Write custom functions to operate on data.
4a. Make two basic plots with matplotlib.
4b. Use GUI library like streamlit to make an interactive visualization.
5. Write markdown cells in Jupyter explaining the code.
